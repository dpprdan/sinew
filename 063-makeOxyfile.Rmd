## makeOxyFile

Function authored by: Anton Grishin

While [makeOxygen](#makeoxygen) is the workhorse for the package it does only print out to the console or a object in the current environment. `makeOxyFile` is a wrapper function for [makeOxygen](#makeoxygen) in order to actively insert [makeOxygen](#makeoxygen) outputs into existing or new files. By default `makeOxyFile` will not overwrite existing files, but will make a copy of the file and name it `oxy-filename.R`.

An empty call will envoke the system file selection dialogue.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
makeOxyFile()
```

Single File

```{r,eval=FALSE}
makeOxyFile("./myRfunctions/utils.R")
```

Batch mode for a directory

```{r,eval=FALSE}
makeOxyFile("./myRfunctions")
```

Additional parameters to [makeOxygen](#makeoxygen) can be passed through

```{r,eval=FALSE}
makeOxyFile("./myRfunctions/utils.R", cut = 5)
```
